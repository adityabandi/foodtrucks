# 🚨 URGENT: Enable GitHub Pages Now!

## What You're Seeing

GitHub is showing the repository's README because **GitHub Pages is NOT enabled yet**.

You need to enable it manually in GitHub settings.

---

## 🎯 STEP BY STEP - DO THIS NOW:

### 1. Go to Settings
Visit: **https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks/settings/pages**

Or manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks
2. Click **Settings** tab (top right)
3. Scroll left sidebar down to **Pages**
4. Click **Pages**

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages

You'll see a section **"Build and deployment"**

**Source**: 
- Select: **"Deploy from a branch"**

**Branch**:
- Select branch: **`main`**
- Select folder: **`/docs`** (NOT root!)
- Click **Save**

### 3. Wait 2-3 Minutes

GitHub will build your site. You'll see:
- ✅ A green checkmark
- 🔗 "Your site is live at https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/"

---

## ✅ What's Ready

Your `docs/` folder contains:
- ✅ `index.html` - The retro diner homepage
- ✅ `styles.css` - All the 1950s styling
- ✅ `app.js` - Static JavaScript (no backend)
- ✅ `data/foodtrucks.json` - All 10,742 trucks

**Everything is ready - just needs to be enabled!**

---

## 🔧 Current Status

```
Repository:     ✅ Exists
Files pushed:   ✅ All there
docs/ folder:   ✅ Clean and ready
GitHub Pages:   ⚠️  NOT ENABLED YET
```

---

## 🎯 After Enabling

Once you enable it and wait 2-3 minutes:

**Your site will be live at:**
https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/

You'll see:
- 🍔 Retro diner homepage
- 🚚 10,742 food trucks
- 🔍 Search and filters
- 🎨 1950s/60s aesthetic
- 🌍 Global coverage

**NOT the README text!**

---

## 📸 What To Look For

In GitHub Settings → Pages, you need:

```
Build and deployment
├─ Source: Deploy from a branch
└─ Branch: 
    ├─ Branch: main
    └─ Folder: /docs  ← IMPORTANT!
```

Then click **Save**

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ Don't select `/root` - select **`/docs`**
❌ Don't select other branch - select **`main`**
❌ Don't wait 0 minutes - wait **2-3 minutes** after saving

---

## 🧪 Test It Works

Once enabled, after 2-3 minutes:

1. Visit: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/
2. You should see: "Classic Street Eats!" header
3. You should see: Retro diner design
4. You should see: Food truck cards

**NOT the README!**

---

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If after enabling you still see the README:

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
2. **Wait 5 more minutes** (initial deploy can be slow)
3. **Check Actions tab**: https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks/actions
   - Should see a "pages build and deployment" workflow
   - Should be green checkmark ✅

---

## ✅ Summary

**The site is 100% ready!**

You just need to:
1. Go to: https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks/settings/pages
2. Select: `main` branch, `/docs` folder
3. Click Save
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Visit: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/

**That's it! Do it now!** 🚀
