## 🎨 Customize Your Site

```

### Change Colors
Edit `docs/styles.css`:

:root {
    --cherry-red: #DC143C;  /* Change this */
    --mint-green: #98D8C8;  /* And this */
}
```

### Add Google Analytics
Add before `</head>` in `docs/index.html`:
```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=YOUR-GA-ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'YOUR-GA-ID');
</script>
```

## 🌟 Add a Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Buy a domain (e.g., streeteats.com)
2. In GitHub Pages settings, add custom domain
3. Add CNAME record in your DNS:
   ```
   CNAME @ adityabandi.github.io
   ```
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site not loading?
- Wait 5 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- Check: Settings → Pages → "Your site is live at..."
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### 404 Error?
- Ensure you selected `/docs` folder in settings
- Ensure `docs/index.html` exists
- Push latest changes: `git push origin main`

### Filters not working?
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Ensure `docs/data/foodtrucks.json` exists
- File size might be too large for some browsers (15MB is okay for modern browsers)

### Images not loading?
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Images are served from external URLs (Unsplash, Yelp)
- Some may be blocked by ad blockers
