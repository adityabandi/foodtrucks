# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

## ✅ Code pushed successfully!

Your changes have been pushed to GitHub. Now we need to enable GitHub Pages:

## Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Visit: https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks
   - Click "Settings" tab at the top

2. **Navigate to Pages**
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click "Pages"

3. **Configure Source**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
   
4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically trigger
   - You can watch progress at: https://github.com/adityabandi/foodtrucks/actions
   - First build will take 2-5 minutes (generating 10,742 pages)

5. **Access Your Site**
   - Once deployed, your site will be live at:
   - **https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks**

## What Happens During Deployment:

1. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push
2. ✅ Installs Node.js dependencies
3. ✅ Runs `npm run build`
4. ✅ Generates 10,742+ static HTML pages
5. ✅ Creates sitemap.xml with all URLs
6. ✅ Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Features Now Live:

- ✅ **10,742+ individual food truck pages** (e.g., `/truck/ft001`)
- ✅ **No external links** - all pages keep users on your site
- ✅ **Rich SEO meta tags** on every page
- ✅ **Schema.org structured data** for search engines
- ✅ **Sitemap.xml** for Google/Bing crawling
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** design
- ✅ **Fast loading** static pages

## SEO Benefits:

Each food truck page now has:
- Unique title: "{Name} - {Cuisine} Food Truck in {City} | StreetEats"
- Custom meta description with rating, specialties, location
- Open Graph tags (Facebook sharing)
- Twitter Card tags
- Schema.org JSON-LD (Google rich results)
- Canonical URLs
- Keyword-rich content

## Example URLs:

- Homepage: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/
- Food Truck: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/truck/ft001
- Sitemap: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/sitemap.xml
- API: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/api/foodtrucks.json

## Verify Deployment:

After deployment completes, check:
1. Homepage loads correctly
2. Click any food truck card
3. Should navigate to `/truck/{id}` (NOT open modal)
4. Each page has complete information
5. No external Yelp links in navigation

## Troubleshooting:

If Pages doesn't show up in Settings:
1. Make sure repository is public
2. Check that .github/workflows/deploy.yml exists
3. Verify Actions are enabled (Settings > Actions > General)

## Next Steps for Maximum SEO:

1. **Submit sitemap to Google Search Console**
   - Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Add property: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks
   - Submit sitemap: https://adityabandi.github.io/foodtrucks/sitemap.xml

2. **Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools**
   - https://www.bing.com/webmasters

3. **Share on social media** to build backlinks

4. **Add structured data testing**
   - https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
